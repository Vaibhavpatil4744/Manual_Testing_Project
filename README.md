# Manual_Testing_Project

Key Features:

Test Cases: 
      The repository includes a well-defined set of test cases covering various aspects of OpenCart, including user registration, product management, order processing, payment 
                    gateways, and administrative functions. Test cases are categorized by module and user role for easy navigation and execution.

Test Scenarios: 
      Detailed test scenarios provide step-by-step instructions for replicating specific user journeys and interactions within the OpenCart platform. This 
                    facilitates consistent and efficient testing across different testers and ensures thorough coverage of key functionalities.

Expected Results: 
      Every test case clearly defines expected results for each interaction. This helps testers identify bugs, regressions, and inconsistencies in OpenCart's behavior.
      
Reporting: The project encourages testers to document their findings using a standardized template. This includes logging bugs, screenshots, and detailed descriptions of 
      encountered issues.
